# utils
This is a module for additional utilities for CHAPSim_post. 
This will contains three submodules:

* gradient
* indexing
* misc_utils

This module also contains the `public' members of these modules
(imported below). The CHAPSim_post package itself will access 
the members of these submodules directly e.g. gradient.Grad_calc
